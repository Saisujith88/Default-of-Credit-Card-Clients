# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
- The Default of Credit Card Clients project involves building a predictive model to predict which customers are likely to default on their credit card payments. This project is important for banks and financial institutions to identify high-risk customers and take preventive measures to reduce the risk of financial losses.
